## To-TRY List
---
- 80 HTTP
    - Web server is running, we can try accessing that
    - Enumerate the directories either manually or automatically.
- 445 SMB
    - We can try using enum4linux to enumerate the SMB share
    - We can try an anonymous login
    - 
- 22 SSH
    - We need some credentials to access this and bruteforcing can take a really long time before the credentials can be cracked. Hence, this is the least of our priorities for pentesting.

## Enumeration
Before anything else, let us first check how the website looks like.


---
### 80 HTTP

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<TARGET_IP> -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t20
```
**`gobuster dir`**: Initiates Gobuster in directory/file enumeration mode.

**`u http://<TARGET_IP>`**: Specifies the target URL.

**`w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`**: Sets the wordlist to be used for brute-forcing common directory and file names. The specified file contains a list of potential paths to check.

**`t20`**: Configures the number of concurrent threads to use during the scan (in this case, 20 threads).
